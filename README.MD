# Backk Example Microservice

Vitja is an example Backk microservice. It offers a full-featured digital second hand marketplace for users to sell their
second hand items. Users can add their own sales items and browse others' sales items. Users can follow other users, like their sales items and
follow sales items for price changes. Users can add/remove sales item to/from shopping cart and place orders.
Vitja will also track the order delivery and possible order return process.

Vitja is written to work with a SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB and any other databases compatible with those) and MongoDB.
You can just change the data store in the src/microservice.ts file to use a different database.
